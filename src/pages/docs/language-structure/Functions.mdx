# Intro

A **_Kin_** function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A **_Kin_** function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Ex

```Kin
porogaramu_ntoya function(a, b) {
  tanga a * b
}
```

## Function Syntax

A **_Kin_** function is defined with the `porogaramu_ntoya` keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

```Kin
porogaramu_ntoya name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  # code to be executed
}
```

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

## Function Invocation

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

```Kin
functionName(argument1, argument2, argument3, ...)
```

## Function Return

When **_Kin_** reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

If the function was invoked from a statement, **_Kin_** will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

```Kin
porogaramu_ntoya myFunction(a, b) {
# Function returns the product of a and b
  return a * b;
}

# Function is called, the return value will end up in x
reka x = myFunction(4, 3);
```

> After **return** statement there must be no other statement under it in a function

So this will produce an error

```Kin
porogaramu_ntoya function(a, b) {
  tanga a*b
  tangaza_amakuru("Product is ", a*b)
}
```

## Why Functions?

With functions you can reuse code

You can write code that can be used many times.

You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.
