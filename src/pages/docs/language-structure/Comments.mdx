# Comments

**_Kin_** comments can be used to explain **_Kin_** code, and to make it more readable.

**_Kin_** comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

# How to

Comments start with `#`.

Any text between `#` and the end of the line will be ignored by **_Kin_** (will not be executed).

This example uses a comment before line of code:

```Kin
# This is a comment
reka x = 10
```

This example uses a single line comment at the end of each line to explain the code:

```Kin
reka x = 5      # Declare x, give it the value of 5
```

> **Note:** **_Kin_** doesn't support multi-line comments. You have to use `#` at the beginning of each line.
