# Intro

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

## Syntax

```Kin
subiramo_niba (condition) {
  # code block to be executed
}
```

## Example

```Kin
reka x = 0
subiramo_niba (x < 100) {
  x = x + 1
  tangaza_amakuru(x)
}
```

> Those codes will print 1, 2, 3, ..., 98, 99, 100

A condition can be as complicated as you want!
