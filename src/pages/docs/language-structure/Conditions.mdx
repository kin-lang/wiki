title: Conditional Statements

# Intro

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In **_Kin_** we have the following conditional statements:

Use `niba` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use `nanone_niba` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use `niba_byanze` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use `gereranya` to specify multiple code blocks to be executed based on different values

## Niba Statement

Use the `niba` statement to specify a block of **_Kin_** code to be executed if a condition is true.

```Kin
niba (condition) {
  # Codes to execute if the condition is true
}
```

> Note that `niba` is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (`Niba` or `NIBA`) will generate a **_Kin_** error.

## Niba_byanze Statement

Use the `niba_byanze` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

```Kin
niba (condition) {
  #  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} niba_byanze {
  #  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

## Nanone_niba Statement

Use Use the `nanone_niba` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

```Kin
niba (condition1) {
  #  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} nanone_niba (condition2) {
  # block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} niba_byanze {
  #  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```

## Gereranya Statement (Switch)

Use the `gereranya` statement to perform different actions based on different conditions. The gereranya statement provides a cleaner alternative to multiple `niba_byanze` statements when testing a variable against many values.

```Kin
gereranya (expression) {
  usanze value1:
    # code to execute when expression equals value1
  usanze value2:
    # code to execute when expression equals value2
  usanze value3:
    # code to execute when expression equals value3
  ibindi:
    # code to execute when expression doesn't match any case
}
```

> **Note:** Unlike some other languages, Kin's gereranya statement doesn't require explicit break statements. Each case automatically stops execution after its block is completed.

### Example

```Kin
reka iletere = injiza_amakuru("shyiramo letere nyamuneka:")

gereranya(iletere){
    usanze "a":
       reka a = 1
       reka b = 2
       tangaza_amakuru(a+b)
       tangaza_amakuru("Iyi letere ni a")
    usanze "b":
       tangaza_amakuru("Iyi letere ni b")
    ibindi:
       tangaza_amakuru("Iyi letere ntayo twize")
}
```
