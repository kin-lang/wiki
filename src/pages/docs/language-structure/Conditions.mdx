title: Conditional Statements

# Intro

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In **_Kin_** we have the following conditional statements:

Use `niba` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use `nanone_niba` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use `niba_byanze` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

## Niba Statement

Use the `niba` statement to specify a block of **_Kin_** code to be executed if a condition is true.

```Kin
niba (condition) {
  # Codes to execute if the condition is true
}
```

> Note that `niba` is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (`Niba` or `NIBA`) will generate a **_Kin_** error.

## Niba_byanze Statement

Use the `niba_byanze` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

```Kin
niba (condition) {
  #  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} niba_byanze {
  #  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

## Nanone_niba Statement

Use Use the `nanone_niba` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

```Kin
niba (condition1) {
  #  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} nanone_niba (condition2) {
  # block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} niba_byanze {
  #  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```
