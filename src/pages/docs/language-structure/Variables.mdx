# Intro

Variables are Containers for Storing Data

**_Kin_** Variables can be declared in 2 ways:

## `reka`

By declaring variables by using `reka` keyword, you can change the value of the variable later in the program.

```Kin
reka x = value
```

Variable `x` is declared and assigned a value of `value` but the value can be changed later in the program.

Also, you can declare a variable without assigning a value to it.

```Kin
reka x;
```

> In this case, the variable `x` is declared but not assigned a value.
> **Note**: You have to add semicolon **_(;)_** at the end of the statement.

## `ntahinduka`

By declaring variable by using `ntahinduka` keyword, you can't change the value of the variable later in the program.

```Kin
ntahinduka x = 10
```

> You can't change the value of variable x later in the program.

> **Note**: You have to assign a value to a constant variable, so this won't work:

```Kin
ntahinduka x; # This will throw an error
```
