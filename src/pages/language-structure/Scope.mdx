# Intro

Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.

**_Kin_** variables have 2 types of scope:

- Function scope
- Global scope

## Functinoal Scope

Variables declared within a **_KIn_** function, are LOCAL to the function:

```Kin
# code here can NOT use carName

porogaramu_ntoya myFunction() {
  reka carName = "Volvo"
  # code here CAN use carName
}

# code here can NOT use carName
```

> Local variables have Function Scope:

> They can only be accessed from within the function.

> Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions.

> Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

## Global Scope

A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL.

```Kin
reka carName = "Volvo"
# code here can use carName

porogaramu_ntoya myFunction() \{
# code here can also use carName
}
```

> Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

> Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a **_Kin_** program.
