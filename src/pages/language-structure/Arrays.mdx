# Intro

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

Ex

```Kin
reka names  = ["Bwenge", "Nyabihu", ]
```

## Why Use Arrays?

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

```Kin
reka car1 = "Saab"
reka car2 = "Volvo"
reka car3 = "BMW"
```

However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

## Creating an Array

Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a **_Kin_** Array.

Syntax:

```Kin
ntahinduka array_name = [item1, item2, ...]
```

Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

```Kin
ntahinduka cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
];
```

You can also create an array, and then provide the elements:

```Kin
ntahinduka cars = [];
cars[0]= "Saab";
cars[1]= "Volvo";
cars[2]= "BMW";
```

## Accessing Array Elements

You access an array element by referring to the index number:

```Kin
ntahinduka cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
reka car = cars[0];
```

> Array indexes start with 0.
> [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.

## Changing an Array Element

This statement changes the value of the first element in cars:

```Kin
reka cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars[0] = "Opel";
```

# Array Methods

### Array Length

You can get the length of an array by using `KIN_URUTONDE.ingano()` method.

Ex:

```Kin
reka ijambo = ["Hello", "World"]
tangaza_amakuru(KIN_URUTONDE.ingano(ijambo))
```

> Output: 2

### Array Include

You check if an array include a given value by using `KIN_URUTONDE.ifite()` method.

Ex:

```Kin
reka ijambo = ["Hello", "World"]
tangaza_amakuru(KIN_URUTONDE.ifite(ijambo, "Hello"))
```

> Output: nibyo

### Array join

You join elements of an array to make one word by using `KIN_URUTONDE.kora_ijambo()` method.

Ex:

```Kin
reka cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
tangaza_amakuru(KIN_URUTONDE.kora_ijambo(cars))
```

> Output: SaabVolvoBMW
