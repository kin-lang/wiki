# Intro

**_Kin_** comes with set of many operators which performs various operations.

In this notebook, we will explain usage of **_Kin_** operators to perform various operations.

## Arthimetic Operators

Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

Ex:

```Kin
x = 1 + 5
```

> operator + was used to add 1 to 5

| Operator | Description                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| +        | Addition                     |
| -        | Subtraction                  |
| \*       | Multiplication               |
| /        | Division                     |
| ^        | Exponentiation               |
| %        | Modulus (Division Remainder) |

> **Note**: If you perform arithmetic operations to strings you'll get `ubusa`. Arithmetic operations on work on numbers and expressions.

## Assignment Operator

Assignment operator is used to assign values to variables.
**_Kin_** uses `=` as assignment operator.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare multiple expressions.

| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| ==       | equal to                 |
| !=       | not equal                |
| !=       | not equal value          |
| >        | greater than             |
| \<       | less than                |
| >=       | greater than or equal to |
| \<=      | less than or equal to    |

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| &&       | and         |
| \|\|     | or          |
| !        | not         |
