# Input

_**Kin**_ provides a built-in function `injiza_amakuru()`, this function is used to get information from the user.

## How to

Getting information from user and store them in a variable:

```Kin
reka x  = injiza_amakuru("Enter the value of x: ")
```

> This will store the value entered by the user in the variable x.

# Output

_**Kin**_ provides a built-in function `tangaza_amakuru()`, this function is used to write information to the user's screen.

## How to

```Kin
tangaza_amakuru("This is message will be printed on user's screen")
```

> This is message will be printed on user's screen

Sometimes you'll need to write multiple things to the screen.

```Kin
tangaza_amakuru("More ", "than ", "one ", "message ", "can ", "be ", "printed ", "at ", "once.)
```

> More than one message can be printed at once.

This also works with variables.

```Kin
reka x = 10
tangaza_amakuru("The value of x is ", x)
```

> The value of x is 10

Both `injiza_amakuru()` and `tangaza_amakuru()` can be used at the same time.

```Kin
tangaza_amakuru("Value of x is: " ,injiza_amakuru("Enter the value of x: "))
```

> Value of x is: 10
