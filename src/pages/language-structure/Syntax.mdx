# Intro

**_A computer program_** is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called **_statements_**.
A **_Kin_** program is a list of programming statements.

## Semicolons ;

In most programming languages like C, C++, ... a semicolon is used to terminate a statement.
In Kin, a semicolon is not required. But there are some use cases where you need to use a semicolon.

- A semicolon is required when you declare a variable but you don't assign a value to it.

```Kin
reka x; # This will work
reka x # This will not work
```

- A semicolon is required when a function returns but there's not expression to return.

```Kin
porogaramu_ntoya main() {
    tanga; # This will work
}
```

In General a semicolon is used to tell **_Kin_** that there's an ommited statement.

## White Spaces

**_Kin_** ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.
The following lines are equivalent:

```Kin
reka x = 5
reka x=5
```
