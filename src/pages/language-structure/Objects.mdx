title: "Objects"

# Intro

You have already learned that **_Kin_** variables are containers for data values.

This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:

```Kin
reka car = "Fiat"
```

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:

```Kin
const car = {
  type:"Fiat",
  model:"500",
  color:"white"
}
```

The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

## Object Definition

You define (and create) a **_Kin_** object with an object literal:

```Kin
reka person = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName:"Doe",
  age:50,
  eyeColor:"blue"
};

# This is the same as:
reka person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
```

Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:

## Object Properties

The name:values pairs in **_Kin_** objects are called properties:

## Property | Property Value

firstName | John
lastName | Doe
age | 50
eyeColor | blue

## Accessing Object Properties

You can access object properties in two ways:

```Kin
objectName.propertyName
```

Or

```Kin
objectName["propertyName"]
```

## Object Methods

A method is a function stored as a property.

Ex:

```Kin
porogaramu_ntoya add (a, b) {
  tanga a + b
}

reka obj = {
  method: add
}
```

In this case our object `obj` has a method named `method` which can perform addition of two numbers.

> Noticide that we didn't declare method inside and object? This is because in **_Kin_** we don't support declaring methods inside objects. We can only assign a function to a property of an object.

### Accessing Object Methods

You access an object method with the following syntax:

```Kin
obj.method()
```

If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the function definition:

```Kin
reka add = obj.method
```
