## Why?

People who don't know English can't start learning programming.
Additionally, many programming languages have boilerplate codes that make it difficult for new people to get easily introduced to programming.
Apart from that, if you find a language that doesn't have those boilerplate codes like `JavaScript`, you'll find yourself enclosed in a very large ecosystem that doesn't favor your learning process.
With `Kin`, problems were fixed where no language constraint exists, and only pre-selected necessary topics were chosen for you.
